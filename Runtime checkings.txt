Absolutely, Umukhadija — especially since your splash screen bridges the gap between app launch and usability, it's the perfect place to verify *mission-critical components*. Here's a rundown of essential elements to check during that stage:

---

### 🧩 **1. Configuration Integrity**
- **What to check:** Runtime config files (e.g., appsettings.json), environment variables, or registry keys.
- **Why:** If these are malformed or missing, your app might crash or behave unpredictably.
- **Bonus:** Use a schema validation or checksum comparison for robustness.

---

### 🔗 **2. Database Connection**
- **What to check:** Reachability, credentials, database existence, version compatibility.
- **Why:** Your WPF app likely pulls live data — without DB access, most features won’t function.

---

### 🔐 **3. Authentication System**
- **What to check:** Token validity, login services, roles/permissions loaded.
- **Why:** Especially for role-based access or hashed credentials — the user shouldn’t hit the login screen unless backend validation is ready.

---

### 🧠 **4. Local or Cached Data Availability**
- **What to check:** Existence and integrity of cached files, local settings, or offline storage (e.g., images, theme settings).
- **Why:** Prevents UI from breaking when trying to load unavailable resources.

---

### 🚦 **5. Service Readiness (Plugins / APIs / Feature Modules)**
- **What to check:** Load and initialize core services like inventory manager, logging system, reporting engine, etc.
- **Why:** If a service silently fails to load and your splash screen hides too fast, user interactions might later trigger unhandled errors.

---

### 🛡 **6. Exception Handling for Startup Errors**
- **What to check:** Try/catch blocks around all startup operations.
- **Why:** Allows you to alert the user with clear messages or retry logic, rather than silently failing or crashing the app.

### ⚙️ Optional but Valuable:

| Component               | Benefit                                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Update Checker**     | Notify user if a new version is available     |
| **License Validator**  | Validate license key or expiry                |
| **Telemetry Pings**    | Log startup event (non-blocking!)             |
| **Dependency Injection** | Register all services and singletons        |

Let me know if you'd like me to create a real-world checklist or reusable `StartupManager` class to orchestrate all these steps cleanly. It would plug perfectly into your modular WPF architecture — like a conductor prepping the stage before the main show. 🎼💡
